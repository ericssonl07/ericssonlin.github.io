        My Passions
    </div>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        As a Chinese-Canadian senior at Hong Kong International School, my passion for
        STEM is deeply rooted in a logical and deductive approach to learning. Rather
        than relying on memorization, I embrace the philosophy of understanding concepts
        through proof, derivation, and visualization. Read more about my pursuits and
        philosophy in the Projects section.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        My fascination with technology extends to machine learning and artificial intelligence,
        fields in which I have cultivated extensive programming skills in C++ and Python.
        This intersection of creativity and logic inspires me to push the boundaries of innovation.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        Parallel to my STEM pursuits, I am also a dedicated pianist with a rich history of
        performing. I began my musical journey at the age of five and have since participated
        in various festivals and international competitions, including the Kaufman Competition in
        New York, the Crescendo Competition in Vancouver, and the Steinway Tom Lee Youth Competition
        in Hong Kong, among others. Currently, I am privileged to study with a professor from the
        Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, continuously refining my craft.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        Through both my technical and artistic endeavors, I strive to integrate discipline and
        creativity, believing that each discipline informs and enriches the other. My journey
        is a testament to the beauty of balance between logic and artistry, a principle I hold
        dear as I continue to explore the vast landscapes of STEM and music.

        My Journey: Past, Present, and Future
    </div>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        Memory does not serve prior—— in year one, at the age of five, I began two journies.
        One, at the keyboard. Another, buried in the depths of the scientific mind.
        I touched the piano keys, beginning to study the music that would accompany me for the
        next decade and the rest of my life. At the school library, I picked up books on astronomy
        and physics, beginning to study the universe at large and the world at small. Meanwhile, a
        computers class introduced me to the world of technology, an interest that would lay dormant
        for several years.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        In grade school, I met a friend named Gordon. I remember recess periods, when we would walk
        around the playground as the other kids kicked soccer balls, played tag, and climbed the rope
        net pyramid structure—— these sessions found him mostly dominating the discussion as he talked
        about physics: weird but fascinating words like protons, neutrons, the strong force, and
        electromagnetism. I didn't understand much of what he said, but I listened, and I learned. With
        the advantage of hindsight, I believe these early days were a gift of inspiration that sparked
        my interest in the sciences permanently. I began to read these same books (particularly memorable
        is Dan Green and Basher's "Physics- Why Matter Matters", featuring illustrated characters that
        represented forces and particles) and to watch documentaries on the universe and the world. While
        all of this was happening, I continued to study the piano professionally, travelling on my first
        competition and concert tour in the summer of 2017, at the age of nine, across China, Canada,
        the United States, and Russia.

    <p class="about-paragraph">
        Fast forwarding to middle school, whence most of my present pursuits began to take tangible
        form. I joined a robotics club out of curiosity, and began to assemble and program LEGO EV3
        Mindstorms robots. These helped me initially explore concepts like structural integrity,
        gear ratios, and control systems (albeit the latter, in a very inchoate form). My interest in 
        technology was revived as I joined the 6th grade coding club, where I took a leap beyond the
        block code of childhood and robotics to the text-based Python and C++. Additionally, as I began to 
        study for the American Mathematics Contest series, I discovered the beauty of mathematical
        elegance and precision beyond elementary algebra and arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        My passions have crystallized today into focused pursuits of STEM and music. Leading a VEX
        robotics club at Hong Kong International School, I mentor three teams through the process of
        building and designing robots for competitions. I draw from my earlier interest in EV3 robotics
        for engineering principles and programming skills. VEX pushed me to my mathematical and programmatic
        limits, as I designed and implemented algorithms for autonomous routines and driver control using
        mathematical principles from disciplines like calculus, linear algebra, and geometry. Leading the
        Math and Science Center and serving around 700 students for review sessions, I've applied and
        tried to share my philosophy of understanding through proof, derivation, and visualization.
        Artificial intelligence and machine learning have also become a significant part of my life,
        as I've begun to explore the applications of neural networks and deep learning in various projects.
        Meanwhile, in the music realm, I've continued to study with a professor from the Hong Kong
        Academy for Performing Arts, Professor Gabriel Kwok, continuing to perform in festivals and
        competitions globally.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        But for the road ahead. I aspire to merge my love for technology with my artistic background
        in music. Should you envision a future where humanity can leverage artificial intelligence to
        beget innovation (whether it be musical, technological, or whatever other forms innovation
        may take), then we are shared in our aspirations. I am eager to contribute to advancements
        in technology that harmonize creativity and logic, creating a more interconnected world where
        art and science thrive together and make a better world for all.

        On Perfection, and Imperfection
    </div>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        A pianist, and any musician in general, starts the daily routine with scales. Like the foundation
        of a building, they are crucial to the development of technique and the ability to play more
        complex pieces with expression and musical "savoir-faire". Indeed, technique is one of the most
        important prerequisites for musicality: without the ability for skillful execution, the music
        and the instrument cannot sing as they should. Let us briefly shift the discussion to robotics:
        a robot, no matter how advanced its AI or how sophisticated its sensors, cannot perform its
        task without the ability to move, to sense, to actuate. Nor can it work effectively if the
        actuation is imprecise, the sensors are inaccurate, or the algorithm is flawed. In this sense,
        both music and robotics share a commonality: the importance of precision and perfection.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        But the scales are not the music itself. They are the foundation, but not the piece de resistance.
        I remember trying to recall precise finger motions at the bench, yet this is impossible: you CANNOT
        codify music into a series of commands. Composers do not yield to the tyranny of the fraction- how
        much to move one's finger, how fast to compress the key, and how long to sustain the note. Instead,
        music requires the musician's life, the musician to inject that life into the notes: let the
        feelings guide the fingers, not the other way around. Why, then, did I discuss robotics, a field
        that seemingly absolutely REQUIRES precision and perfection? Because the same principle applies:
        attempting to achieve perfection in robotics is a fool's errand. This is the reason for the
        existence of the design process: it's not possible to create a perfect robot on the first try,
        and attempts to do so beget indefinite delays. And this is also the reason for redundancy, and
        error-correction with sensor fusion: the robot will never be able to perfectly reproduce the
        environment, so it is similarly unrealistic to expect it to do so. I learned this the hard way in
        EV3, where I spent hours adjusting the precise angles and time values for motors, only to be met
        with frustration as the results varied inconsistently.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        To conclude, I quote Immanuel Kant: "Experience without theory is blind, but theory without
        experience is mere intellectual play." So, in this delicate balance between two antithetical forces,
        let us remember that the human experience is not perfect, and neither should our creations be.
