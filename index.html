    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I am a Chinese-Canadian senior at Hong Kong International School who loves STEM. I enjoy learning subjects through a logical, deductive lens. Instead of formula memorization, my philosophy is that of learning by proof, derivation and visualizations. I lead a club of three teams in VEX robotics. I'm passionate about machine learning and artificial intelligence, and have had extensive experience programming in C++ and Python. In addition, I am a professional pianist, having participated in and earned awards from multiple festivals and international competitions like the Kaufman competition in New York, the Step Towards Mastery competition in St. Petersburg, the Crescendo competition in Vancouver, the Nanyang International Music Competition virtually, the Steinway Tom Lee Youth competition in Hong Kong, and the Cooper Piano Competition at Oberlin College. I first began playing at age 5 and have received instruction from various teachers, as well as played in several masterclasses. Currently I am studying with a Professor from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.</p>
